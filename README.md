## What?
Batch FBX-exporter for Cinema4D. 
Got loads of c4d files needed to be exporter to FBX for further pipeline use? I got your back.


## How?
Place the script in \AppData\Roaming\MAXON\{cinemaversion}\library\scripts or just run it straight in cinema's script-manager

Below an example of usage. Insert the path of the files you want to export and it makes a new fbx-folder in same directory.
